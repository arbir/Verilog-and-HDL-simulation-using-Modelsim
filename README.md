# Verilog-and-HDL-simulation-using-Modelsim
Read CA1.pdf
In this assignment, you will get familiar with Verilog coding and HDL simulation using
Siemens EDA Questa (Modelsim). You start by installing/running Questa, writing an
HDL code, and simulating the hardware description of a simple function. You then
receive the RTL design of a simple MIPS processor and modify its arithmetic and logic
unit (ALU) to add a new instruction.
